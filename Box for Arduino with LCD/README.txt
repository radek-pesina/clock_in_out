Box for Arduino with LCD by olddave59 on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1398822

Summary:
A big thanks to Heartman for the Ultimate Box Maker.  The box size is 50 x 90 x 100 mm and I modified the front and back panel to accept an LCD 1602  and connections for an Arduino Uno.  The openings for the Arduino are about a 1 mm low and requires some trimming.  0.2 mm layers with %50 infill.  No raft or supports.  The components are hot glued into place.
